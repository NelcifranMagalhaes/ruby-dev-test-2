# Add new inflection rules using the following format. Inflections
# are locale specific, and you may define rules for as many different
# locales as you wish. All of these examples are active by default:
ActiveSupport::Inflector.inflections(:en) do |inflect|
  inflect.irregular 'player_album', 'players_albums'
  inflect.irregular 'PlayerAlbum', 'PlayersAlbums'
end

# These inflection rules are supported but not enabled by default:
# ActiveSupport::Inflector.inflections(:en) do |inflect|
#   inflect.acronym 'RESTful'
# end
